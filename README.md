# 📂 File Handling & Error Handling Challenge

## 📝 Description
This project demonstrates **file reading, writing, and error handling in Python**.  
The program:
1. Reads text from an input file.
2. Converts all text to **uppercase**.
3. Counts the number of words in the file.
4. Writes the processed text and word count into a new file called `output.txt`.
5. Handles errors gracefully if the file is missing or cannot be read.

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Program
1. Make sure you have Python installed (>=3.6).
2. Create a text file with at least 5 lines (example: `input.txt`).
3. Save the Python script as `file_handling_challenge.py`.
4. Run the script in the terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   python file_handling_challenge.py
